Merge branch 'main' of github.com:jimmy93029/jupyter_website
# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
# especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.
#
# Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts
# the commit.
I am not knowing what I have done, I just follow the tip on "Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart" 
I hope there is no error after I merge
